"""Weft scope engine: deterministic, deny-by-default, fail-closed.

This is the component that prevents the ACS-class contamination failure. It runs
BEFORE any validation, ranking, or model call. A model may never widen scope.

Design rules (docs/architecture.md):
  1. Unknown or unstated scope -> deny.
  2. Exclusion happens before ranking, not after.
  3. Content determines scope. A record whose text names another scope's
     registered marker is mis-scoped and is refused for reads and writes.
  4. Derived artifacts (peer cards, summaries) are NOT injectable units.
  5. Cross-scope access requires a named target and user attribution.
  6. Ambiguous attribution -> fail closed.

Security boundary (decision, Oct 24, after three review rounds):
  The GRANTED-SCOPE checks are the security boundary. Read, write, and delete
  are decided by ScopeContext.granted_scopes and by explicit, attributed
  cross-scope requests. Content markers are a best-effort defence in depth that
  catches mis-filed content. They are not a guarantee, because no character
  table covers every lookalike. The residuals are recorded in
  docs/adr/0001-phase1-decisions.md.

Authority model (review fix, a37d175 F1-F6):
  - Reading needs a granted scope, a global allowlist entry, or a named,
    attributed cross-scope request.
  - Writing and deleting need a GRANTED scope only. The allowlist and
    cross-scope reads never confer write or delete authority.

This module is pure and synchronous. It does no I/O and makes no model calls.
