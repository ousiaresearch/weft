# Weft — Competitive Gap Closure Plan

**Created:** 2026-10-29  
**Goal:** Close the highest-impact gaps between Weft and comparable open-source memory providers.  
**Constraints:** clean-room only for external systems; AGPL-3.0; adversarial review before each phase is called closed.

---

## Gap inventory and priority

| Priority | Gap | Why it matters | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | No standardized benchmarks | Credibility gate; every serious provider publishes LoCoMo / LongMemEval / BEAM numbers. Without them, Weft is "unverified" in procurement and comparison. | 9 |
| P0 | No MCP server | MCP is the dominant integration surface for Claude Code, OpenClaw, OpenCode, and Hermes. No MCP = no agent adoption outside custom code. | 10 |
| P1 | No background extraction / consolidation | Pull-only `ingest` commands limit real-time agents. Honcho, Mem0, ByteRover all extract in the background. | 11 |
| P1 | No graph or temporal reasoning | Cognee, Hindsight, Zep/Graphiti all offer entity/temporal graphs. This is the #1 feature request in agent memory benchmarks. | 12 |
| P2 | No procedural memory / agent-curated state | LangMem and Letta let agents rewrite their own procedures. Differentiator for long-running, self-improving agents. | 13 |
| P2 | No managed or turnkey deployment | Mem0 Cloud, Honcho Cloud, Cognee Cloud lower the barrier to try. Weft currently requires CLI + Python. | 14 |
| P3 | Community and ecosystem | Stars, Discord, integrations, plugins. These are lagging indicators of product-market fit, not leading ones. Close after P0–P2. | 15 |

## Phase 9 — Benchmark suite (P0)

**Goal:** Publish reproducible benchmark results on the field's standard evals.

**Deliverables:**
1. `benchmarks/` directory with harness code.
2. LoCoMo, LongMemEval-S, and BEAM (1M / 10M if feasible) adapters.
3. Gold-token validation and abstention assertions (same pattern as Phase 7 evaluation runner).
4. Independent adversarial review of benchmark harness before first publish.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Harness runs on a single command from `README.md`.
- Gold answers and reproduction steps are committed.
- Results are published in `docs/benchmarks/` and referenced in `README.md`.

## Phase 10 — MCP server (P0)

**Goal:** Expose Weft recall and ingest as an MCP server so any MCP client can use it.

**Deliverables:**
1. `weft/mcp_server.py` — stdio MCP server wrapping `recall`, `ingest`, `rebuild-fts`, `status`.
2. `weft/mcp_tools.py` — tool definitions with scope validation and deny-by-default enforcement.
3. Entrypoint `weft-mcp` in `pyproject.toml` scripts.
4. Tests: tool schema validation, scope denial, recall receipt formatting.
5. Adversarial review.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `weft-mcp --help` works from a fresh venv install.
- Claude Desktop / OpenCode / Hermes config examples in README.
- All scope invariants enforced at the MCP boundary.

---

## Phase 11 — Background extraction / consolidation (P1)

**Goal:** Add an optional background extractor that consolidates raw records into scoped summaries without breaking the single-file, no-dependency model.

**Deliverables:**
1. `weft/extraction.py` — optional background extraction module (not imported unless requested).
2. CLI commands: `weft extract --scope <scope>`, `weft consolidate --scope <scope>`.
3. Config: `extraction.enabled`, `extraction.model`, `extraction.cadence`.
4. Tests: extraction produces Correction records when facts change; consolidation reduces record count; fail-closed on model errors.
5. Adversarial review.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Extraction runs synchronously or via a background worker; substrate never blocks on it.
- Default install is unchanged; extraction requires `pip install weft-memory[extraction]`.

---

## Phase 12 — Graph / temporal reasoning (P1)

**Goal:** Add optional entity linking and temporal validity windows without requiring an external graph database.

**Deliverables:**
1. `weft/temporal.py` — bi-temporal validity windows on records.
2. `weft/entity_link.py` — entity extraction and linking using the local embedder (no external graph DB).
3. SQLite schema extension: `entity_links` table, `valid_from` / `valid_to` columns.
4. Retrieval boost: linked entities increase relevance score.
5. Adversarial review.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Entity links are stored in the same SQLite file; no new infrastructure.
- Queries can filter by `effective_at` for temporal grounding.
- Default install unchanged; graph features require `pip install weft-memory[graph]`.

---

## Phase 13 — Procedural memory / agent-curated state (P2)

**Goal:** Allow agents to propose procedural rules and prompt refinements, gated by user attribution.

**Deliverables:**
1. `weft/procedural.py` — `ProposedRule` status; only `Decision`/`Commitment` records with user attribution promote rules to `active`.
2. CLI: `weft propose-rule`, `weft active-rules --scope <scope>`.
3. Tests: rules are deny-by-default; no rule activates without user-attributable Decision.
4. Adversarial review.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- Proposed rules never enter active retrieval without explicit user attribution.
- Rules are scoped; identity grants nothing.

---

## Phase 14 — Turnkey deployment (P2)

**Goal:** Lower the barrier to evaluation with a Docker image and optional managed signup flow.

**Deliverables:**
1. `Dockerfile` — builds wheel, installs with `[server]`, exposes `8765`.
2. `docker-compose.yml` — single command: `docker compose up`.
3. `docs/turnkey-deployment.md` — Docker and FastAPI server guide.
4. Managed signup page placeholder on ousiaresearch.xyz pointing to Docker for self-hosters.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- `docker compose up` produces a running server in under 60 seconds on a machine with Docker.
- No external dependencies beyond the container image.

---

## Phase 15 — Community and ecosystem (P3)

**Goal:** Build visibility and integration surface after P0–P2 are shipped and reviewed.

**Deliverables:**
1. GitHub Discussions enabled.
2. Discord server for users and contributors.
3. Integration docs for Hermes, OpenCode, Claude Code.
4. Good first issue labels and contributing guide.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- 10 GitHub stars within 30 days of Phase 10 MCP announcement.
- 3 external integrations (Hermes plugin, OpenCode memory adapter, Claude Code MCP config) documented.

## Sequence and dependencies

```
Phase 9 (benchmarks) ──┐
                       ├── README credibility update ── Phase 15 (community)
Phase 10 (MCP) ────────┤
                       ├── Phase 11 (background extraction)
Phase 12 (graph) ──────┤
                       ├── Phase 13 (procedural)
Phase 14 (Docker) ─────┘
```

Phases 9 and 10 can start in parallel. Phase 11 depends on Phase 10 being reviewed so extraction results can be exposed via MCP. Phase 12 can proceed independently. Phase 14 depends on Phase 10 (server). Phase 13 and 15 depend on 9–12 being closed.

Each phase stops for adversarial review before it is marked complete. No phase is considered finished until the reviewer returns APPROVED.
